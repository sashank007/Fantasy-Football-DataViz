                        is the EPL fantasy premier league data set utilized. The data set consists of the premier
                        league 17/18 stats of players,clubs and the fpl figures related to them. The Premier League is
                        the
                        most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and
                        a
                        potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. This data set provides us with FPL stats of 461
                        players
                        of the 17/18 English premier league. The goal of this project is to find trends within this

                    <p>Right off the bat, we want to know which players make the most impact region wise. By
                        identifying the
                        regions which have the highest impact, we can narrow down our search. Seeing the graph, it is
                        obvious
                        that English players have the highest impact followed by players from Spain. It is not a
                        surprise
                        that English players in the "English Premier League" are dominating. The size of the bars
                        provide
                        us with insights into if they are part of the big clubs or not. Let us go deeper into
                        understanding
                        the impact of these English players.

                        <p>After seeing the huge impact of the English players in EPL, we want to learn more about
                            them. In
                            the above visualization, we can see that we have now filtered based on the English
                            nationality
                            and are displaying the average Fpl points they have gained. The labels presented are the
                            average
                            ages in each team. Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester City have the highest average players
                            per
                            English players but there is something interesting with respect to the average ages in each
                            team.
                            Let us now see how age impacts the player's performance.

                    <p>Age plays a very big part in any sport. Each sport has a different prime age for performance. It
                        could
                        range from 19 to even 40(Tiger Woods is 42!). The graph above displays the average ages of all
                        players
                        in the EPL with respect to the total FPL points they have gained. You can see that there is
                        steady
                        growth starting from 17 to 27 and then a sudden decline. The average age depicted is 27.5 and
                        peak
                        being 27. This graph helps us in understanding the criteria for choosing players based on the
                        age.
                        Choosing a player in the peak clusters is the best for your team. We see this better in the

                    <p>This visualization gives a clearer picture of its parent graph. You can see that this time, the
                        criteria
                        are given for the position each player plays in. The position category depicts where the player
                        plays.
                        As a player reaches the age of 27, it is better to pick a player who is either in the offensive
                        region
                        or the midfield. As the player's age increases, offensive players do not pick up as many points
                        and
                        is more recommended to pick a goalkeeper or a defensive player. This graph helps us understand
                        the
                        different positions with respect to the player's age.

                    <p>After understanding how important age group and nationality is, we now try to merge the two data
                        fields
                        and depict the intersection of these two prime trends. FPL value plays a big role in selection
                        of
                        players since many times we might not have sufficient funds to select all the top players we
                        want.
                        In this situation ,we would want a low cost high yield player. The green bars depict players
                        below
                        the average fpl value. These players are high yield low cost. We can see that in this region
                        Nathaniel
                        Clyne, Ryan Bertrand, Androws Townsend and Steve Cook are just few of the best players you can

                    <p>Filtering on the 3 positions ( CB, CF, CM) we see the best players yielding the highest points.
                        CF and
                        CB have the same number of players in the cluster (14) and the CM are only 6 although Delle
                        Alli
                        leads the number of fpl points. Clustering based on positions helps us pick the best out of
                        each
                        and provides us with insights into what our team composition can consist of.
